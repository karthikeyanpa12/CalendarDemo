# SPO recruitment task for Frontend Developers

Hello! If you are here then you reached the coding challenge for Frontend Developers at SPO! 
This coding challenge should represent a task that is very close to what we are usually work on at SPO.
You should take no more than 5h to complete this task.

The souce code of the solution should be provided as a bunch of files (or via github repo). It is highly recommended to use some build tools (preferably webpack) and push all the sources to git repository so you will be able to demonstrate also your ability of working with build tools and git itself. Please note that **code quality** is also important for us.

Good luck to you and hope you will enjoy the process while solving this task!


## Create a demo calendar application

The aim of this exercise is to create a demo calendar application using React & Redux. You can use 'npm mock-json-server' to mock the server data and do the proper API calls. You need to use *REST API* to get the data.

Our focus is on the functionality of the calendar, especially on the data fetching. And don't worry, if you can't finish it in the given time, we will just have a look at what you have done so far and you can explain your code to us :-)

You can be creative with your idea of the calendar. You could do a daily list view calendar or stick more to this example:
